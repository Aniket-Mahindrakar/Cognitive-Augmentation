In working on the assignment about the positive effects of smartphones on cognitive development, I initially faced the challenge of selecting a topic that effectively highlighted how building habits through smartphone applications could enhance productivity. Once the topic was finalized, the task of compiling information about various applications, such as physical fitness apps, mental fitness apps, task management apps, and more, became relatively straightforward.

One of the most significant takeaways from this assignment was the experience of collaborating with team members who were initially strangers. I found myself taking on a leadership role, helping to bring together the various resources, keeping the team focused on the chosen topic, and ensuring that team members collaborated effectively while enjoying the process. This assignment taught me the importance of effective teamwork and leadership in achieving common goals. It was a rewarding experience to see how different applications and habits can contribute to cognitive development and productivity when utilized optimally.
