**Introduction**

In the modern world adopting healthy habits is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In particular mobile applications have become invaluable tools for building and sustaining positive features for physical health, and for some the creation of positive sustained habits. Physical exercise can change cognitive implications, and specific mobile apps empower individuals to maintain and enhance this crucial habit. [1]


**Mobile Apps for Physical Exercise**

The world of mobile applications has witnessed a surge in fitness-related apps designed to guide, motivate, and track users' exercise journeys. There are various categories of physical exercise apps, including fitness tracking, workout planning, nutrition tracking apps, and even other categories of apps that promote exercise. These apps serve as digital personal trainers, offering guidance and motivation to individuals on their fitness journeys.

- **Fitness Tracking Apps**: These apps monitor activity levels, heart rate, and other fitness metrics, providing users with valuable insights into their progress. They help individuals stay on track by quantifying their physical efforts.

- **Workout Planning Apps**: These apps offer curated workout routines tailored to an individual's fitness level and goals. They provide structured exercise plans that eliminate the guesswork from exercise regimens.

- **Nutrition Tracking Apps**: Proper nutrition is integral to a successful fitness routine. Nutrition tracking apps assist users in managing their dietary intake, ensuring they fuel their bodies effectively for exercise and recovery. 
  
- **Gaming Apps**: There are some applications that manage to incorporate fitness into the game. Pokémon Go encouraged players of all ages to go explore their surroundings for Pokémon and gyms. This led to an increase in walks, and in the short term great increase in overall physical activity [2]

**Cognitive Benefits of Using Physical Exercise Apps**

The cognitive advantages of regular physical exercise are profound. Exercise positively impacts memory, focus, mood, and cognitive function. By using mobile exercise apps, users can amplify these cognitive benefits and the amount of exercise they maintain. There are benefits such as:

- **Improved Memory**: Regular exercise has been shown to enhance memory and cognitive function. Mobile exercise apps encourage users to stick to their exercise routines, resulting in consistent cognitive benefits. [3]

- **Enhanced Focus**: Exercise promotes increased focus and concentration. Apps that provide structured workouts help users maintain their concentration during exercise sessions and, subsequently, in other aspects of life.

- **Mood Enhancement**: Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins, promoting a positive mood. Exercise apps serve as motivators, making it easier for users to experience these mood-boosting effects.

- **Cognitive Function**: Regular exercise improves cognitive function and helps combat cognitive decline. Exercise apps provide a structured approach to maintaining and enhancing cognitive well-being.


**Conclusion**

In summary, mobile apps for physical exercise are not just tools for monitoring activity; they are gateways to better cognitive function and overall well-being while encouraging further and consistent use. The cognitive benefits of regular exercise are amplified when individuals harness the guidance and motivation provided by these apps. By adopting and maintaining exercise habits, individuals can experience improved memory, focus, mood, and cognitive function.

These apps play a vital role in encouraging consistent physical activity, making them powerful allies in the journey towards cognitive augmentation and enhanced well-being. The relevance of these topics extends to the field of computing systems for cognitive augmentation, emphasizing the critical role technology plays in cultivating positive habits for a healthier and more cognitively empowered future.
