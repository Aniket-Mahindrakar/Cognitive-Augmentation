**Introduction**
The rise of digital platforms and the need for communication across multiple languages and countries has increased the importance of effective language-learning systems, especially learning English [1]. As such, there has been a rise in the development of digital language learning (DLL) systems and research into the efficiency and effects of DLL systems as opposed to more traditional language learning methods [2]. 

**Enhancing Cognitive Function Through Language Learning Apps**
Apps like Duolingo and Babbel are two DLL systems that utilize 'gamification': including game elements in situations that aren't strictly games. This includes elements like giving users badges or EXP for completing tasks, introducing a streak, or having a leaderboard [1]. These game elements can help with habit formation (such as Duolingo's streak system) and motivation.

There are a number of factors that affect a person's ability to effectively learn a new language, including fear of failure or judgement and lack of motivation or interest [1]. Gamification can decrease the effect of those factors, and studies have shown that people learning English as a second language describe gamified systems as more engaging and find it to be more effective in actually helping them learn the language [1]. 

Traditional methods of learning a second language typically involve directly associating words in a second language with the translation of that word in the learner's native language. Mentally, a learner will then link objects and concepts with the word in their native language before connecting it to the word in the second language [2]. The way that native languages are learned, however, usually involve perceptions and actions in the physical word being linked to the concept or object being learned as well as the word itself. This is generally seen to be more effective and allows for a greater understanding of the language [2]. The paper by Li et al. references Barsalou's embodied cognition theory to explain the way that children typically learn their native language [3]. Relating objects and concepts to audiovisual or tactile experiences allows them to be more effectively embedded into our mental representations of them.

**Conclusion**
The development of new systems that make use of the latest technological and digital advancements takes us a step in the direction of making language learning more effective and engaging. Using the digital tools at our disposal allows us to tailor the learning experience in a way that meshes more effectively with how our minds usually learn and retain things. Taking advantage of the things that we understand about cognition and how it works can allow people to learn languages and connect more effectively.
